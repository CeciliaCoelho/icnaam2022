[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/lululxvi/deepxde)](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde/blob/master/LICENSE)

This library provides a Jupyter Notebook to replicate the experiments done in the paper "The role of adaptive activation functions in Fractional Physics-Informed Neural Networks", see reference [[add link]](https://arxiv.org).

Note that this repository has a copy (not the latest) of the official DeepXDE library [[1]](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) with some modified portions of code: added code to print the values of the adaptive variables after training is completed, the number n in 'LAAF-n' was converted to be the initialization of the adaptive variables.


## Usage

- Clone/Download the complete repository;
- Open the jupyter notebook inside.
